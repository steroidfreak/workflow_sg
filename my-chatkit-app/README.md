# Chatkit Conversation Hub

Chatkit is a lightweight Next.js workspace that lets Workflow SG teams orchestrate agent conversations in a dedicated UI.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is served on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Docker build

The production container is built via the multi-stage `Dockerfile` in this folder:

```bash
docker build -t workflow-chatkit .
```

The resulting image exposes port `3000` and runs `node server.js`, which is generated by `next build` with the standalone output.
